This is a new interface written for GNUnet using the Qt framework.
For now is written using QWidgets and the Qt 4.8, but I often check and compile using the Qt 5.0 Beta.

One guideline of this project is to not couple The GNUnet communication core with the Graphical interface, using signals as the only communication way.
In the future I plan creating a Mobile version, and this is fundamental for accomplishing this task.

Anyone is welcome to participate, we need developers, this is without a doubt the future of File Sharing ! Let's help us build the future!
